# Tanks
Thhis is an old project I made years ago. I decided to recreate it.

## Controls
Green Tank:
Moves with “wasd” keys
Fires with “q”
Secondary weapon is a missile and is fired with “e”

This unit is slower but has more health.

The best way to win with this unit (that I have found) is to keep your distance and make every hit count. Try not to let the opponent in close. Your missiles will take the opponent down to one hit-point if you never miss a shot. The weapons will be reloaded five seconds after both tanks are completely out of ammunition.

Yellow Tank:
Moves with arrow keys
Fires with “/“
Secondary weapon is a (work-in-progress) flamethrower and is fired with the shift key
Unfortunately, I could not specify just one shift key, so both shift keys fire it. I’ll figure it out.

This unit is faster but has less health than the other.

The best way to win with this unit (that I have found) is to conserver your ammunition until your opponent has nearly
expended all of theirs and get in close. You can fire both the flamethrower and the main cannon at the same time to do more damage.
Just watch out for those missiles.
